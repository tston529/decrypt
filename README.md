# Alphabet Cipher Decryption

A goofy side project to read from a dictionary list of your choice (I had been using enable1.txt, find on GitHub elsewhere) and spit out an decrypted message from a string encrypted with an alphabet cipher (a 1-to-1 character replacement).

## Getting Started

Here's a few tidbits of information that may or may not be useful to you.

### Prerequisites

C++14

### Installing

I've been compiling with g++, with C++14 (though I suspect C++11 should also work)

Just run the makefile.

## Running the tests

As of my last commit, it should spit out a file called out.txt which contains an exhaustive list of every match the program finds among similarly-structured words.
Again, I've been using 'enable1.txt' as my dictionary, but if you find a better one, feel free to use it (and modify the main.cpp to recognize another dictionary file)
